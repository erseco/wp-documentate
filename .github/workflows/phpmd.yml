# PHPMD is a spin-off project of PHP Depend and
# aims to be a PHP equivalent of the well known Java tool PMD.
# What PHPMD does is: It takes a given PHP source code base
# and look for several potential problems within that source.
# These problems can be things like:
#   Possible bugs
#   Suboptimal code
#   Overcomplicated expressions
#   Unused parameters, methods, properties
# More details at https://phpmd.org/
